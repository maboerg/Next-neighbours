# Next-neighbours
An open problem concerning next neighbours in a planar graph

Next neighbours - introduction

"Next neighbours" is a project related to graphs and plane geometry. The aim of the project is to discuss an open problem which will be named "Next Neighbour Problem".

The Next Neighbour Problem has a simple explanation in real world terms. Consider a village where, on a certain day, everyone visits her or his next neighbour.

To make things easier we will think of n houses with pairwise different distances.

For most arrangements of houses there will be some villagers who do not receive visitors.

What about the number m of visited houses? There is an infinite number of possible arrangements of the n houses. So (for n>3) different m will appear in these arrangements. It is easy to establish the maximum for m and not so easy to establish the minimum for m. In fact, the latter is an open problem (as far as the author knows).
